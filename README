Try it first

  http://rintarou.dyndns.org/tests/SWFVisualizer.html



How to build

  1. Install FlashDevelop + Flex 4.0 SDK compiled SWF10 binary
  2. Open "SWFVisualizer.as3proj" and run it.



Setup for your own services

  SWFVisualizer should work with my another project(https://github.com/RintarouTW/swfparser).
  If you want to use swfparser to build your own service, modify Global.as:

    swf2jsonURL : 			"http://rintarou.dyndns.org/tests/swf2json.php?swfURL=",
    uploadswf2jsonURL :		"http://rintarou.dyndns.org/tests/uploadswf2json.php",

  to the URL of your own services.
  


Patch of other source

  I patched lib/com/adobe/serialization/JSONDecoder.as for ordered key array.
  If you update the library on your own, remember this patch.
